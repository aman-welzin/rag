The president on Thursday said that the US would impose 25 per cent tariffs on all vehicles and foreign-made auto parts imported into the country.\\n\\nThe new tariffs, effective from April 3, could add thousands of dollars to the cost of an average US vehicle purchase and impede car production across North America. Introducing levies on imported cars and their components is expected to revive the US automobile industry.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nTrump said the duties could be a net neutral or even good for Tesla, adding that its CEO, and his close ally, Elon Musk, did not advise him regarding auto tariffs.\\n\\nIn a post on X following the news, Musk said the tariffs would also affect Tesla.\\n\\n\\u201cThis will affect the price of parts in Tesla cars that come from other countries,\\u201d he wrote in another post on X. \\u201cThe cost impact is not trivial.\\u201d\\n\\nHow will it affect India?\\n\\nWhile India\\u2019s direct automobile export to the US is meagre compared to countries like Japan, Mexico and Canada, the secondary effects of Trump\\u2019s tariffs are expected to impact the Indian industry.\\n\\nReports indicate that in 2023, India\\u2019s auto parts exports to the United States were valued at around $1.5 billion.\\n\\nHowever, the introduction of new tariffs could significantly impact this trade, raising production costs for US automakers and potentially lowering demand for Indian auto parts. As a result, suppliers might struggle with shrinking profit margins, either absorbing the higher costs or seeking alternative export markets.\\n\\nWhich companies will be hit?\\n\\nMany Indian auto companies started to feel the ripples of Trump\\u2019s tariffs as shares went down following the Potus\\u2019 announcement.\\n\\nTata Motors does not directly export its cars to the US, but its subsidiary Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has taken a hit. The shares of Tata Motors was down by 5 per cent on Thursday.\\n\\nAt the same time, Eicher Motors, the manufacturer of Royal Enfield motorcycles, may also be affected, as the US represents a key market for its 650cc models.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nWith inputs from agencies\",\n          \"Neeraj Chopra has confirmed that the NC Classic javelin event will now be held in Bengaluru on 24 May.

The event, which was originally scheduled to be held at Tau Devi Lal Stadium, has now been shifted to Sree Kanteerava Outdoor Stadium in Bengaluru. It will be held on the same date, 24 May.\\n\\nExplaining the venue change, Neeraj said the stadium lighting in Panchkula did not meet the international standards required by World Athletics.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIn an online press conference on Monday, Neeraj confirmed the update and shared exciting details about the competition, which has been officially granted Category A status by World Athletics, meaning it will carry major ranking points for qualification to global events like the World Championships.\\n\\nA dream come true for Neeraj\\n\\nNeeraj said organising a world-class javelin event in India has been a long-time dream for him. \\u201cThis has been a long-standing dream. When I travelled abroad, I was in awe of the global competitions and how the athletes were supported there. I often wondered if India could host an event of that standard, where top athletes from around the world would come to compete, and our athletes could share the field with them. Finally, such an event is going to happen in India,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nThe idea of naming the event after himself came from a conversation with his coach Jan Zelezny, who pointed to other similar events like the Mondo Classic, named after pole vault star Mondo Duplantis.\\n\\n\\u201cThe idea behind the Neeraj Chopra Classic is inspired by a few athletes and my discussions with coach Jan Zelezny. He suggested naming the event after me, as Mondo Duplantis has an event named after him, and there are other similar events as well. I found inspiration in these and am really excited about it,\\u201d he added.\\n\\nBig names confirmed\\n\\nNeeraj shared a preliminary list of international stars who have confirmed their participation in the NC Classic.\\n\\nAnderson Peters (Grenada)\\n\\nThomas Rohler (Germany)\\n\\nJulius Yego (Kenya)\\n\\nCurtis Thompson (USA)\\n\\nAthletes from Brazil and other European countries\\n\\nNeeraj himself will also compete at the event, making it a rare chance for Indian fans to see the Tokyo Olympics champion throw live on home soil.\\n\\nNeeraj on Arshad Nadeem\\n\\nWhen asked about Pakistan\\u2019s Olympic gold medallist Arshad Nadeem, Neeraj said the invitation has been sent, and Arshad told him he would discuss with his coach before confirming. As of now, there is no official word, but Neeraj is hoping he will join.\\n\\nThough Neeraj and Arshad are fierce competitors on the field, they share a good bond off it. Their friendship became well known after the Paris Olympics, when defending champion Neeraj\\u2019s mother praised Arshad for his record-breaking throw that denied her son the gold medal.\",\n          \"Tourists lodged in and around the area where the attack happened were seen flocking out of Jammu and Kashmir on Wednesday.
